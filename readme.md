# MnP club's Computational Physics Projects 2024
## An introduction to Quantum Machine Learning
This project is aimed at understanding Quantum circuits, especially for learning problems.  
I have actively used IBM's [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit) for hands on implementation of the circuits.  
## Assignment 1
- To start with Qiskit and quantum circuits, I have implemented a Quantum Teleportation circuit, simuating it using the Aer simulator and also on IBM's Quantum processors.
## Assignment 2
- Here, I have implemented a [Variational Quantum Eigensolver](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09265).
