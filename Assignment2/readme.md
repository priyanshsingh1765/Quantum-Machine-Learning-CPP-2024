# Assignment 2
- Here, I have implemented a [Variational Quantum Eigensolver](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09265) for a given hamiltonian, formulating a parameterized ansatz.
- I have used the minimize routine in Scipy.
- This is followed by a comparison with Qiskit's built-in `NumPyMinimumEigensolver` for the final eigenvalue and eigenstate.
